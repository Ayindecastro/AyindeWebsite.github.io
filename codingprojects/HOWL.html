							<h1>HOWL</h1>
							
							<p>Howl™ is a location-based, educational matchup platform that connects people with similar subject interests. The main function of Howl™ is to match people who need help in certain subject areas with others in need or people who have experience in those areas. For example, a student who needs help studying for a physics test can Howl™ for help and get matched with others who are studying the same topic or set a beacon for others who want to study with him. Through Howl™, you will build your network of study partners, or your “wolfpack”, that you consistently study with. Furthermore, Howl™ is location-based so that you can work with your “wolfpack” face to face, as many times working over web-based chat can be more inefficient. However, we will still offer web-based chat that can be used if people would like to set a rendezvous point or cannot meet in real life.
